# Logic Field-Oriented Computing (LFOC)

**Version 4.4.1 – Logic Monitor**  
by **Alessandro Sgarbi**

---

## Concept

**LFOC** models computation as a **living logical field** where data, memory, and logic continuously interact.  
Each node represents a logical particle influenced by the **Barycentric Memory (BM)** — a dynamic center of coherence that evolves through time, storing and releasing informational energy.  
This creates a visual and mathematical bridge between **CPU–RAM dynamics** and field-oriented computation.

## Features

- Interactive 2D simulation of logical nodes  
- Real-time **Logic Monitor** showing:
  - Mean / Min / Max distance from BM (`dn`)
  - **Entropy (σ)** → system coherence  
  - **Energy** → field activity level  
- Fetch / Decode / Execute / Repeat control buttons  
- Dynamic trail of BM evolution (memory persistence)
- Adjustable parameters: `ALPHA`, `BETA`, `ENERGY`, `NOISE`, `MEMORY_DECAY`

## Run the Simulation

**Requirements**
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
