# Logic Field-Oriented Computing (LFOC)

**Version 4.4.1 – Logic Monitor (Fix)**  
by **Alessandro Sgarbi**

---

## Concept

**Field-Oriented Computing (LFOC)** explores computation as a **dynamic logical field** where data, logic, and memory coexist as a unified system.  
Each node behaves as a logical particle interacting with others through coherence, entropy, and energy exchange — visualizing the **CPU–RAM continuum** as a living information space.

## Features

- Interactive 2D logic field simulation  
- Parameters: `ALPHA`, `BETA`, `ENERGY`, `NOISE`, `MEMORY_DECAY`  
- Real-time Logic Monitor displaying:
  - Mean / Min / Max distance (`dn`)
  - Entropy (σ)
  - Energy state
- Fetch / Decode / Execute / Repeat control buttons  
- Dynamic trail and field visualization

## Run the simulation

**Requirements**

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
