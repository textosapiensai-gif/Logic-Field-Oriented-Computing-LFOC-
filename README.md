# Logic-Field-Oriented-Computing-LFOC-
Field-Oriented Computing (LFOC) explores computation as a **dynamic logical field** where data, memory, and logic interact as a unified system. This experiment simulates node coherence, entropy, and energy flow to visualize the **CPU-RAM continuum** as a living, oriented information space.
